# DevOps with Cloud AWS

## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computer services without the need of physical infrastructure like hardware equipment. It can deliver any service over the internet giving the user the access to more storage, for example, without having to buy physical hardware.

## What are the main benefits?

It has several benefits but there are 4 important pillars of benefits of cloud computing:

1. Cost-effective - the management and costs of equipment are removed or lowered
2. Ease of use / user friendly - the user only sees the front page of what the cloud providers work on to deliver the service
3. Security - the providers are reponsible of protecting firewall, so it is more reliable
4. Scalable and collaborative

## Why should we use Cloud, as DevOps engineers, and how does it fit into the DevOps culture?
We should use cloud services because it serves the purposes of DevOps, for its benefits, as it fits into our needs of improving collaboration, automation of processes and faster deployment.
Many Cloud services such as AWS and Azure provide the tools for automation needed in DevOps.

## How does it benefits a business?

As mentioned above, Cloud services provide many benefits, ones any organisation could benefit from, but the ones to highlight are:
- the cost savings from the reduction of upfront capital a business needs to invest for IT infrastructure; 
- the scalability allows businesses to modify their resources according to their own needs at any given time, without the need of large investments
- and the security that cloud providers give, makes business rely on them more to protect valuable data
