- What is DevOps

DevOps is a software development culture/methodology that  combines Development and Operations by enhancing collaboration and communication between the developers and the operations team of a project. It is the bridge to break the gap in communication between the two teams, and a way of sharing reponsabilities in a project. Development teams and Operations teams, don't work together often, so DevOps lower the risk of finger-pointing in this and make more efficient use of resources by using automation.

- Why DevOps (what are the benefits):

1. Faster time-to-market: By reducing the time it takes to develop, test, and deploy software, DevOps can help businesses to respond more quickly to changing market conditions
2. Continuous release cycles: DevOps promotes the use of automation and streamlines processes, which can reduce manual work and improve efficiency. This can lead to increased productivity and cost savings
3. Increased quality of deliverables due to continuous testing

- What is the role of DevOps in a team - what do DevOps engineers do

The role of DevOps engineers is to bridge the gap between software development and operations, and to ensure that software is developed, tested, and deployed efficiently and reliably. Some of the key responsibilities of DevOps engineers include:

1. Automating the software development process: DevOps engineers are responsible for creating and maintaining automated processes for software development, testing, and deployment. This include creating scripts and workflows, configuring infrastructure as code, and integrating tools and systems such as cloud computing.

2. Ensuring the reliability of software: We work to identify and resolve issues that can impact the reliability of software, such as bugs, performance bottlenecks, and security vulnerabilities and use tools and techniques like automated testing and monitoring.

- What is Cloud Computing and explain why AWS is one of the big ones

Cloud computing is the delivery of computer services without the need of physical infrastructure like hardware equipment. It can deliver any service over the internet giving the user the access to more storage, for example, without having to buy physical hardware. It is cost-efficient because of the reduction of upfront capital a business needs to invest for IT infrastructure; it can also be modified according to a business or user's own needs at any given time, without the need of large investments; and the security that cloud providers give, makes business rely on them more to protect valuable data

- How does cloud fit into DevOps - how can DevOps engineers deploy AWS

We should use cloud services because it serves the purposes of DevOps, for its benefits, as it fits into our needs of improving collaboration, automation of processes and faster deployment. Many Cloud services such as AWS provide the tools for automation needed in DevOps. AWS stands out from other cloud services because of its range of services, scalability and flexibility, cost-effectiveness, as companies can pay as they go, strong security and compliance, and strong ecosystem and community.

- What are the benefits of Cloud computing - who is using

It has several benefits but there are 4 important pillars of benefits of cloud computing:

1. Cost-effective - the management and costs of equipment are removed or lowered
2. Ease of use / user friendly - the user only sees the front page of what the cloud providers work on to deliver the service
3. Security - the providers are reponsible of protecting firewall, so it is more reliable
4. Scalable and collaborative

Many companies in the UK use cloud computing, as it has become increasingly popular and mainstream in recent years. Some of the major companies in the UK that use cloud computing include NHS, SKY, BBC and HSBC, for example.


- Conclusion

In conclusion, DevOps and cloud computing are two essential technologies that work hand in hand to improve collaboration, automation, and efficiency in software development and deployment. AWS, one of the biggest cloud computing services, stands out from others due to its range of services, scalability, cost-effectiveness, strong security, and ecosystem. The benefits of cloud computing include cost-effectiveness, ease of use, security, scalability, and collaboration, which have made it increasingly popular among businesses in the UK such as NHS, SKY, BBC, and HSBC.
